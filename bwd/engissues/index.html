					<h3>Chronological order</h3>
					<p>In an introduction to your backgrounds, always start with more remote events and then proceed to more recent ones.</p>
					<h3>Redundancy</h3>
					<p>There is always something that you can simply in your English writing, so this issue will always be the one I put emphasis on.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><q><s>Alongside my academic performance, based on my current ability to give something back to the society</s>, I have volunteered to lecture basic science concepts and instruct high school students…</q> &#8594; <q><em>With the ability building upon my academic learning</em>, I have volunteered…</q></li>
						<li><q>I am Syue, Wen Rou. and most of my friends call me <s>Nata, which is my English name in short</s>.</q> &#8594; <q>I am Syue, Wen Rou, and most of my friends call me <em>Natalie (Natasha?) or just Nata</em>.</q> </li>
						<li><q><s>I am going to share a bit about myself.</s> I grew up in Taipei and all my schools before university are within the same district, so home has always been my favorite safe place to be.</q></li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Connection/Transition</h3>
					<p>Remember, try to connect sentences whenever they are relevant and the end result is not going to be a super-long sentence (more than three lines in Word with the standard font settings). And you also need to make logical transitions between sentences.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><q>I am a hardworking student<s>. I require myself to thoroughly understand the content related to courses</s>.</q> &#8594; <q>I am a hardworking student <em>and I have been devoting myself to the thorough understanding of course contents</em>.</q></li>
						<li><q>My name is XXXXX. I am a college student in National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan now<s>. My</s> major is Foreign Language and Literature</q>. &#8594; <q>My name is XXXXX. I am a college student in National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan now with a major in Foreign Languages and Literature.</q></li>
						<li><q>Instead, I feel curious about special things<s>. And, I hope</s> myself to be a person who dares to dream and be creative.</q> &#8594; <q>Instead, I feel curious about special things <em>and I expect</em> myself to be a person who dares to dream and be creative.</q></li>
						<li><q>I love piano, <s>however,</s> I have to spend considerable time practicing for being a good piano player.</q> &#8594; <q>I love piano, <em>but</em> I have to spend considerable time practicing for being a good piano player.</q></li>
						<li><q>After taking literature course, I learn more about the ancient history and value, and my critical thinking is improved. <s>Alternatively</s>, I have joined the Glow Performance Club and became one of the club cadres.</q> &#8594; <q>After taking literature course, I learn more about the ancient history and value, and my critical thinking is improved. <s>Additionally</s>, I have joined the Glow Performance Club and became one of the club cadres.</q></li>
					</ul>
					<h3>"As for", "about", and "with regard to"</h3>
					<p><q><s>In terms of the independent study, our</s> theme is "Reconfigurable Modular Robot Motion Control” <s>and is</s> divided into hardware and software groups.</q> &#8594; <q><em>I am currently collaborating with other students to work on an independent study, and the</em> theme is "Reconfigurable Modular Robot Motion Control”. <em>We are</em> divided into hardware and software groups supervised by the instructor is Dr. Wei-Yu Chiu.</q></p>
					<h3>Tense issues</h3>
					<p>You probably don't need to use the future tense in all cases, but you need to be consistent in using the past tense in many cases.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><q>When encountering a problem, I <s>will</s><em>always</em> try to understand the cause and do my best to solve it.</q></li>
						<li><q>Besides, I attended Bee Partner Program held by the Office of Global Affairs. The program <s>is</s><em>was</em> set up to help Newbies <s>,</s><em>and</em> foreign students in NTHU<s>,</s> get familiar with new environment in a short time and ease cultural shock caused by cultural difference.</q></li>
						<li><q>I <s>have worked</s><em>used to work</em> as an intern in the “Center for Corporate Sustainability” of “Taiwan Institute for Sustainable Energy” for two months in 2020…</q></li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Long sentence</h3>
					<p>Maybe you'll keep doing this unconsciously, but always check if you need to break a super-long sentence into half.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><q>As starting up my own business and inventing products or even opening up a new industry that is beneficial to the society has been one of my long-term future plans, I have been endeavoring to consolidate the fundamentals<s>, which</s><em>. This process</em> enables me to exploit rigorous chemical engineering skills, concepts, and knowledge more cleverly to achieve this goal.</q></li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Avoid "I"s or "We"s</h3>
					<p>This is going to be a major issue in many autobiographies since it's always difficult to avoid "I"s and "We"s. I probably will have to keep providing relevant examples...</p>
					<ul>
						<li><q>I moved to New York City to attend Columbia University in 2017. <s>Inspired by t</s><em>T</em>he dynamic art scene of the City and Columbia’s activist communities <em>greatly inspired me</em><s>, I decided</s> to study visual arts and sociology. Beyond academics, I have been involved in film and theatre design, including Off-Broadway shows, immersive shows and commercials.</q></li>
						<li><q><s>With t</s><em>T</em>he eight-year experience of playing the piano<s>, I can be</s><em>makes it</em> easier <em>for me</em> to learn other instruments, such as violin, ukulele and guitar. But I am poor at singing. Even though I practice a lot, I am still easy to be out of tune.</q></li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Grammar/Wording</h3>
					<p><q>I <s>will</s><em>plan to</em> graduate in one year.</q></p>
					<p><q>I’m an undergraduate student of National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan currently studying Foreign Languages and Literature (FLL) <s>and also</s><em>as well as</em> Economics.</q></p>
					<p><q>Function is <s>beauty just as much</s><em>just as beautiful</em> as form, but <s>combining the two is an</s><em>only the combination of the two could be acknowledged as</em> ART.</q></p>
					<p><q>…double<em>-</em>majoring in English and Education.</q></p>
					<p><q>…they are also related to my interest, and who knows<em>?</em><s>, w</s><em>W</em>ith the knowledge, I might be able to see films from different perspectives.</q></p>
					<p><q>In my <s>spree</s><em>spare(?)</em> time...</q></p>
					<p><q>Contrary to <em>the</em> common belief, art does <em>not(?)</em> have right and wrong.</q></p>
					<p><q>I am Chan Hiu Laam, or <s>called</s><em>you can call me</em> “Zita”.</q></p>
					<p><q>Studying linguistic, like phonology, phonetic, syntax, <s>is</s> contribute<em>s</em> to <s>me for</s><em>my analysis and learning of</em><s>analysing and learning</s> different languages.</q></p>

					<h3>Content</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Do not use give the last name first in your writing, as the comma used to single out your last name would confuse your readers:
							<p>
								<q>Hi, my name is <s>Chen, Tsung-Ying</s>.</q> &#8594; <q>Hi, my name is <em>Tsung-Ying Chen</em>.</q>
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>Please focus more on yourself and what you have done or what you're currently doing, rather than the people around you (e.g., your family). Your autobiography is supposed to show some more professional side of you.</li>
						<li>Following the above suggestions, you should be discrete about being vague in your personal website.</li>
						<li>Describe who you really are first (if you think this is necessary), and then elaborate on what you have done.</li>

							<p><q><s>carelife club</s></q> &#8594; <q>Care-life Club</q></p>
						</li>
						<li>There is no need to talk about yourself from a third-person perspective.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Organization</h3>

						<li>Less is always more

								<q>I am currently learning how to write creatively, well, struggling to put my scattered thoughts into a complete paragraph is probably a more precise description. <s>Anyway,</s> words to me are like a refugee or an alternative world for the disturbed, and ultimately a provider of different ways we can view the world.</q>

								<q>However, I found out that this kind of "interesting and productive" life wasn’t what I wanted. Therefore, I started to spend time on things that I am interested in. I spent time practicing my drawing skills, learning how to edit video clips, and working out to keep myself fit.</q> &#8594; <q><em>However, I found this "interesting" life to be in fact uninteresting, so I followed my heart and shifted my focus. I started to learn drawing and video-editing and work out regularly to get fitter.</em></q>
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>Avoid lengthy statements
							<p>
								<q>In the seminar of Phonetic theory, she gave out her first try in designing a perceptual experiment to testify one of the controversial claims proposed by modern speech perception theories<em>. Deeply attracted by the experimental approach to theory-testing, she then chose</em> the topic for her term project<s>,</s> as well as her future research focus<s>, since she found using experimental design in theory-testing to be really attractive.</s></q>
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>Connect relevant sentences (if the result is not a lengthy sentence)
							<p>
								<q>Hi, I’m Chris, or you can call me Yon-Gjun Hou in Chinese. I was born in Chiayi <em>in a family of five</em><s>. There are five people in my family</s>.</q>
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>Make a proper contrast
							<p>
								<q>The most difficult part in teaching them is to design some games which can help them to remember those words quickly, but <s>for most of the time</s> <em>in the end</em>, I’m <em>always</em> happy to see them learn with joy and have progress.</q>
