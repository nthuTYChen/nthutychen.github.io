				<h1>1. Introduction</h1>
				<p>Welcome to Bilingual Web Design offered in Fall 2021! Here's the introduction to this course to help you get ready.</p>

				<section>
					<h2 id="#whythiscourse">Why this course?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>First of all, you probably want to learn some <em>practical</em> skills.</li>
						<li>Second, you need a Webpage to present your profile/works/personality.</li>
						<li>Third, Web Design helps cultivate your logical thinking and creativity.</li>
						<li>Finally, you still need to practice your English writing skills.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2 id="whattolearn">What to learn?</h2>
					<h3>HTML5, CSS, JavaScript(!!!)</h3>
					<p>HTML5 and CSS are probably more entertaining since you get to see what you create immediately. JavaScript is perhaps a bit more <em>intimidating</em> - After all, computer programming sometimes means <em>a steep learning curve.</em></p>
					<p>But that's exactly why you're here, to step out of your comfort zone, and that's why I'm <em>teaching this course in Chinese</em> (the materials are still in English, though).</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2 id="whatdoyouneed">What do you need?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>A <em>GitHub account</em> to host your Webpage (see <a href="#preparationworks">Preparation</a> below). You can use the Web space provided by NTHU, but the Web address may look a bit <em>dumb</em> (for example: http://oz.nthu.edu.tw/~g10xxxxxx).</li>
						<li>Textbook...? <em>No</em>, you can just follow my materials. But there are two textbooks that are digitally accessible in the NTHU library database for your references:
							<em>
								<p>Murphy et al. (2012). Beginning HTML5 and CSS3: The Web Evolved. New York: Springer.</p>
								<p>Fielding, Jonathan. (2014). Beginning Responsive Web Design with HTML5 and CSS3. New York: Springer.</p>
							</em>
						</li>
						<li>A laptop/computer. Feel free to use the computer in C522, but you're encouraged to bring your own laptop for your own convenience and for <em>security reasons</em>.</li>
						<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn" target="_blank">MDN Web docs</a> - A complete and detailed guide for Web development.</li>
						<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3CSchool</a> - Another good online Web development tutorial.</li>
						<li><a href="https://jsfiddle.net/" target="_blank">JSFiddle</a> - A place for you to experiment different HTML, JavaScript, and CSS codes.</li>
						<li><a href="https://google.com" target="_blank">Google</a> - I'm not kidding.</li>
						<li>The source codes of each lecture example in <a href="https://github.com/nthuTYChen/bwdMaterials/tree/main/examples" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</li>
						<li>The source codes of each developmental stage of the course demo website in <a href="https://github.com/nthuTYChen/bwdMaterials/tree/master/progress" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</li>
						<li>The source codes of every quiz in <a href="https://github.com/nthuTYChen/bwdMaterials/tree/master/quizzes" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</li>
						<li>The Corpus of Contemporary American English: <a href="https://www.english-corpora.org/coca/" target="blank">https://www.english-corpora.org/coca/</a></li>
						<li><em>Meticulous efforts and a tough mindset.</em></li>
					</ul>

					<h2 id="courserequirements">Course Requirements</h2>
					<p>Your performance in this course will be assessed with the following criteria:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><em>Quiz (40%)</em><br/>
							Almost every lecture will end with a quiz. You will be assigned a Web design task and you need to complete it before the end of the lecture.
						</li>
						<li><em>Bilingual Personal Website (40%)</em><br/>
							Students have to build a bilingual personal website with the Web design skills they learn in this course. The personal website must be completed on <em class="extra">Jan 21, 2022</em>, which will be assessed based on its aesthetic features, English and Chinese writing quality as well as completeness. <em class="extra">Templates cannot be used to build the bilingual personal website, and no plagiarism is allowed, or the project will NOT be graded.</em>
						</li>
						<li><em>Bilingual Thematic Website (20%)</em><br/>
							Students are also required to follow the course guidelines to build a website focusing on a structural analysis of an <em class="extra">expository English essay</em> selected from The New York Times. The essay to be analyzed by the students must be approved by the lecturer before <em class="extra">Oct 8, 2021</em>. The English essay analysis website must be completed on <em class="extra">Jan 21, 2022</em>, which will be assessed based on its consistency with the course demo website as well as the guidelines instructed to complete the analysis. Here is the <a href="/bwd/analysisdemo/">demo website</a> for this project.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2 id="preparationworks">Preparation Works</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Get a <a href="https://github.com" target="blank">GitHub account</a> to host your webpage. Your account will be part of your GitHub page domain name (https://xxxxxx.github.io, where xxxxxx is your account), so make it count.</li>
						<li>Download <a href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="blank">GitHub Desktop</a> to manage your Web design projects at GitHub. (Advanced: Take advantage of GitHub's <a href="https://education.github.com/pack#offers" target="blank">student pack</a>.)</li>
						<li>Get a text editor that can make your Web design process smoother: <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/3" target="blank">Sublime Text</a> or <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/" target="blank">Notepad++ (Windows Only)</a>.</li>
						<li>Follow the instruction at <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="blank">GitHub Pages</a> to build a "repository" on your GitHub page (Choose "User or organization site" in 1 and "GitHub Desktop" in 2).</li>
						<li>Follow the instruction to clone your repository to your computer, create an <em class="extra">index.html</em> file, and Commit and Publish (Push Origin) to sync the changes to your repository. <a class="examples" href="https://github.com/nthuTYChen/nthutychen.github.io/blob/master/bwd/examples/basictemplate.html" target="blank">Default Template</a></li>
						<li>See if you can access to your GitHub page.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2 id="moreongithub">More on GitHub</h2>
					<p>One nice thing about sync your project with GitHub is that GitHub allows you to track the changes you have made. Click on any file in your repository, and you would see the History button in the top-right corner:</p>
					<picture>
						<img src="img/history.png"/>
					</picture>
					<p>That's also the reason why you see + and - signs in your GitHub Desktop whenever you make and save some changes in your local respository:</p>
					<picture>
						<img src="img/localchanges.png"/>
					</picture>
					<p>As you move on, you'll make more and complex changes. And that's why you need to provide a good <em class="extra">Summary and Description</em> about the changes you make (this would also be vital in collaborative works):</p>
					<picture>
						<img src="img/summary.png"/>
					</picture>
					<p>GitHub has some other very nice and useful features, but know how these things work would be enough for you to work on your own in this course.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2 id="filestructure">The file structure of your repository</h2>
					<p>Now that you have created your first page in your repository, let's take a moment to dig deeper into the file structure of your repository. It's always a good habit to organize your files logically. People can be lazy, and they would choose to put everything in the same folder. They would then later suffer the mess and I do not feel sympathetic for them :-).</p>

					<p>First of all, the local folder (xxxxxxx.github.io) for your repository in your computer is the <em class="extra">root directory</em> of the repository. The <em>index.html</em> file in this root directory would always be the default webpage loaded to a Web browser when someone visits your website at https://xxxxxxx.github.io/ (which is thus in fact equivalent to https://xxxxxxx.github.io/index.html). This root directory should be used for your personal website project.</p>
					<p>If you create another folder in the root directory of your repository, such as <code>analysisdemo</code> for your , the folder could be accessed via <em>https://xxxxxxx.github.io/analysisdemo/</em>, and the default webpage that will be loaded in this folder will still be <em>index.html</em>. Now, you have the following file structure in your repository:</p>
					<table>
						<tr>
							<td>xxxxxxx.github.io/</td><td>─ index.html (default webpage in the root directory)</td><td></td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td></td><td>┕ /analysisdemo/ (for your Essay Analysis project)</td><td>─ index.html</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
					<p>Eventually, you will have to style your website and add interactive functions to it, so you will need folders for these files for styling and interactive functions, which we call <code>css</code> and <code>js</code> for now. The location of these directories has different implications with regard to how they will be accessed in the entire website. First, let's create the two folders inside your <em>root directory</em>, which implies that the files in these two directories will be used <em class="extra">globally</em>, rather than by any specific webpage in a specific folder.</p>
					<table>
						<tr>
							<td>xxxxxxx.github.io/ (root)</td><td>─ index.html (default homepage)</td><td></td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td></td><td>┕ /analysisdemo</td><td>─ index.html</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td></td><td>┕ /css (global css files)</td><td></td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td></td><td>┕ /js (global js files)</td><td></td>
						</tr>
					</table>
					<p>If you have any specific styles for your Essay Analysis website, you should then create another <code>css</code> folder inside the <code>analysisdemo</code> folder:</p>
					<table>
						<tr>
							<td>xxxxxxx.github.io/ (root)</td><td>─ index.html (default homepage)</td><td></td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td></td><td>┕ /analysisdemo</td><td>─ index.html</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td></td><td></td><td>┕ /css (specifically for analysisdemo)</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td></td><td>┕ /css (global css files)</td><td></td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td></td><td>┕ /js (global js files)</td><td></td>
						</tr>
					</table>
					<p>Now, let's add another three folders in the root directory for your personal website, code examples, and the progress of building the essay analysis website:</p>
					<table>
						<tr>
							<td>xxxxxxx.github.io/ (root)</td><td>─ index.html (default homepage)</td><td></td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td></td><td>┕ /analysisdemo</td><td>─ index.html</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td></td><td>┕ /personal</td><td>─ index.html</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td></td><td></td><td>┕ /css (specifically for analysisdemo)</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td></td><td>┕ /css (global css files)</td><td></td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td></td><td>┕ /js (global js files)</td><td></td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td></td><td>┕ /examples</td><td></td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td></td><td>┕ /progress</td><td></td>
						</tr>
					</table>
					<p>Every student should have the same file structure in their repository for this course, and <em>I will only assess the contents in https://xxxxxxx.github.io/personal/ and https://xxxxxxx.github.io/analysisdemo/.</em>.</p>

					<p>Before you even start to think about the website you want to design, why not refer to some mesmerizing sites first for some insight?</p>

					<p>Which colors can represent you the best? Which colors do touch your heart the most? Are these colors <span style="background-color: #33cc33;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: #33cccc;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> visually harmonic? Or this color combination <span style="background-color: #ff6600;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: #009999;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> may not work for you? Feel it: <a href="https://coolors.co/palettes/trending" target="blank">Trending Color Palettes at Coolors.co</a></p>
					<p>And some color combinations are just more efficient for making contrasts: <a href="https://colorbrewer2.org/" target="blank">Color Brewer 2</a></p>
					<p>In addition, a good Web design always comes with a proper choice of fonts: What is a good font for headings/sub-headings/contents? How to choose from hundreds of fonts generally offered by <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="blank">Google Fonts</a>?</p>

					<p>For the next unit, you will have to complete the following tasks:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Find a website that impresses you the most.</li>
						<li>Find a website that you think to have a poor design.</li>
						<li>Send me the link to your Web design project with the English spelling of your Chinese name <em class="extra">before the next class</em>, which will be shared in this website.</li>
